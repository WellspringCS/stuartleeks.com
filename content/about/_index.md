Hello!

As well as enjoying blogging I find it a useful way to keep a record of things that I might want to look up again. The process of putting an idea in my head down in words is also a powerful way of structuring my thoughts (and frequently making me realise that I don't understand it as well as I thought). Doing this in public on a blog means that I can share the post with others if it turns out to be relevant, and also helps deter me from taking shortcuts in the write-up process that would take away some of the value.

Anyway, that is a long-winded way of saying that since this process is geared up to be for my benefit I make no assertions that what I say is actually correct or useful to anyone else. Use any content here at your peril.

I'm currently working as a Software Engineer for Microsoft in the UK. I'm sure it goes without saying that this is my personal blog and all opinions here are my own (but just in case that's not obvious, I've said it now anyway).

I enjoy [writing and speaking]({{< relref publications-and-speaking >}}) and [creating and contributing]({{< relref projects >}}) to OSS projects.
