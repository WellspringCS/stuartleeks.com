I get a lot of enjoyment from sharing ideas in both written and spoken form. This page has a summary of publications and speaking events.

## Writing

In addition to this blog and the items below I also previously blogged at <https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/stuartleeks>.

### WSL 2: Tips, Tricks and Techniques

After a number of blog posts and user group sessions on the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), I was approached by Packt Publishing to write a book! The books is a practical, hands-on tour of WSL and covers tips for working with it alongside Windows Terminal, Docker, Kubernetes and Visual Studio Code

### MSDN Magazine

#### October 2018 - Deploying to Azure App Service and Azure Functions

Sadly MSDN Magazine is no longer active, but I was invited to write an article of the different deployment options available for Azure App Service and Azure Functions: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2018/october/azure-deploying-to-azure-app-service-and-azure-functions>

#### July 2011 - Get the Most out of WebGrid in ASP.NET MVC

After an engagement with a customer onboarding to ASP.NET MVC (and familiar with WebForms) I put together some helpers for ASP.NET MVC for working with tabular data in a rich way based on the (then) newly release WebMatrix helpers. After some encouragement from a colleague I submitted a proposal for a magazine article based on this and it was accepted :-)  <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2011/july/msdn-magazine-asp-net-webgrid-get-the-most-out-of-webgrid-in-asp-net-mvc>

### Just Azure

In 2014 I spent some time working with Azure API Management with a customer, which led to me writing a couple of articles about it for Just Azure magazine (since acquired by Redgate)

* [November 2014 - An Introduction](https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/cloud/cloud-development/azure-api-management-part-1-an-introduction/)
* [March 2015 - Safeguarding Your API](https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/cloud/cloud-development/azure-api-management-part-2-safeguarding-your-api/)

## Speaking

Speaking has been a part of most of my roles in some way (even unofficially) for the last decade and is something that I get a lot of enjoyment from. The list below are the highlights that I recall, but I'm sure that there are some that I will have missed!

### May 2019 - Microsoft Build Conference - From dev to production: Container lifecycle, monitoring, logging and troubleshooting

I was thrilled to be invited to present at the Microsoft Build conference in Seattle.

Abstract: As developers push intellectual property to registries, how will you secure and protect that IP? Additionally, how do you ensure that once those applications are deployed they properly running and in good shape? In this session we'll cover building container images, image scanning, signing and promotion across environments. Then we will look at the tools and knowledge you need to keep your containerized applications healthy and how to detect when something goes wrong.
